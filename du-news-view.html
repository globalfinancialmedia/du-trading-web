                            <p>Mubasher: The Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation (APICORP) estimates that planned and
                                committed investments in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will exceed $792
                                billion over the next five years from 2020 to 2024.</p>
                            <p>The estimated value marks a $173 billion decline from last year’s estimation, which is
                                mostly in planned investments due to what APICORP calls the 2020 triple crisis.</p>
                            <p>The triple crisis is referring to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its related
                                health crisis, coupled with the oil crisis and the looming financial crisis, according
                                to the MENA Energy Investment Outlook 2020-2024.</p>
                            <p>However, the outlook report mentioned that despite the difficulties, committed
                                investments in the GCC region increased by 2.3% compared to a 6% overall decrease in the
                                entire MENA region.</p>
                            <img class="du-img-fluid mb-3 d-block du-mx-auto" src="./assets/images/image-49.png" alt="">
                            <p>In addition, the report referred to the current dilemma in dealing with the consequences
                                of the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing that the resumption of travel and trade will
                                require international coordination.</p>
                            <p>APICORP estimates the price of Brent crude oil to average $30-40 in 2020 and 2021 before
                                reflecting a more balanced market.</p>
                            <p>As for the financial crisis, the report noted that stimulus plans could create enormous
                                unproductive debt that could negatively impact economic growth.</p>
                            <p>“The nature of this triple crisis and the profound restructuring in oil and gas will hit
                                energy investments for a potentially long period of time, sowing the seeds of supply
                                crunches and price volatility. Therefore, we expect a W-shaped recovery for the MENA
                                region,” said Ahmed Ali Attiga, CEO of APICORP.</p>
                            <p>Attiga further noted that despite the positive effects of digitization and automation on
                                efficiencies across the value chains, many fundamental questions remain, which will
                                negatively affect investments.</p>
                            <p>“International collaboration between the private and public sector will, therefore, be
                                critical to counter the expected shortfalls in investment,” the CEO added.</p>
                            <p>APICORP expects “a restructuring of the value chain, thus putting the strongest countries
                                and companies from a total cost and leverage standpoint in the best position to preserve
                                their long-term value proposition and return to their respective shareholders,”
                                according to Leila R Benali, Chief Economist, Head of Strategy, Energy Economics and
                                Sustainability of APICORP.</p>
